Once upon a time there was a software engineering teacher named Dr. Mehlhase.
Her favorite thing to do was to eat apfelkuchen.
She lives in a schloss that encompasses servers.
She lives to drive a BMW.
She also likes to drive Porsche in full speed.
She often spent her weekends relaxing at the local Biergarten.
And she enjoys a Brot while viewing the scenery.
Rammstein is her favorite band.
She met a pet hund named Eltz one day at a ratskeller and they enjoyed gebaeks until the end of time.
